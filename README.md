# Database Project

This Project was made for the course of "Information Systems and Databases' at our university. It is built as a sample for a small enterprise that sells, installs and mantains security systems, gate automations, and video surveillance systems. The project report is divided into 4 parts:
1. Requirements
2. ER modeling (conceptual schema)
3. Logic modeling for the relational database (logic schema)
4. SQL codification (DDL & DML)

To test the SQL code it was used MySql Server, run on my desktop via Docker.

The project was made in collaboration with student *Sebastiano Secchiaroli*.
